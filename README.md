pg_bible
========

Short python bot to proceduraly generate text from a given text. Currently includes the tyndall bible.

Two options- 

"-m=<filename>" Analize a file and produce a histogram from it(takes significant amounts of time(the bible takes 9minuites, and produces a 3mb histogram, though in theory the time is exponential- A 0.5mb file should only take 3, not 4.5 mins.)).

"-p=<length>" Generate a string of text from this histogram, The text is generated by choosing a word at random, taking a list of all the words that follow it, and choose one at "random" weighted by the number of times that it follows the previous word in the source text.

Example usage 

"./makehistogram -p=140|xargs twitter set"

Help text available with a -h
